This repository contains the .csv files for two 2 x 2 SPR experiments based on Kush, Lidz, &amp; Phillips, 2015, Exp. 2b, as well as a .csv where I combined the data for both exps. The 2 SPR studies only differed in the position of object pronouns (preverbal or postverbal). Thus, the combined .csv has 3 factors: Referentiality, GenderMatch, Position.
